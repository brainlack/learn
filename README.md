# Learning BrainLack
Of course, you may want to have followed the [docs](https://brainlack.github.io/) if you want to go here.

# Syntax
So our syntax is pretty bad.

It consists of using brackets as a source of syntax. You may find all of that [here](https://github.com/brainlack/brainlack/blob/main/compiler.js)

# Running a simple hello
In order to run `console.log(hello);`, you might want to type this in:
```
,][,,[[]],,][][,,[[[],,[[]],,[[[[,,[[[,,[[][]],,[[[[,,[[]],,][[,,[[[]]]]],,[][][]][][,,]][,,[[[,,[[[[,,[[[[,,[[]],,[][][]][][,,[[][]]],,[][][]][[[[,
```
Notice how theres not a single letter or number? well we made it that way to make YOUR job harder.

## Syntax

You place a comma (,) before starting your letters since that was how the syntax was written. After each comma, you are going to need to place the letter in which you want to place followed by another comma. In this case, `h` was marked as `,]][,` and `e` would be followed as `,[[[,`.

Another thing you might have noticed is the fact that the code ends in a comma, that was intentional since we ARE a hard language.

Essentially, you just have to learn JS and all our bracket encoding. Listed below.

## List of letters/numbers
```
a = ,[[,
b = ,[],
c = ,][,
d = ,]],
e = ,[[[,
f = ,[]],
g = ,][[,
h = ,]][,
i = ,][],
j = ,[][,
k = ,]]],
l = ,[[[[,
m = ,[][],
n = ,][][,
o = ,[[]],
p = ,[][[,
q = ,][]],
r = ,]]]],
s = ,[[[],
t = ,]][],
u = ,[[][,
v = ,[[[],
w = ,[]][,
x = ,]][[,
y = ,[[[[[,
z = ,[][[],
1 = ,[[][],
2 = ,[][][,
3 = ,[[][]][[,
4 = ,[[[[],
5 = ,[[][]][],
6 = ,[[]][],
7 = ,[[[]],
8 = ,[[[]]],
9 = ,[]][]],
0 = ,[[[]],
. = ,[[][]],
( = ,[[[]]]]],
' ='[[][]]],
_ = ,[[][[[],
  = ,[[]][][,
+ = ,[][][]][,
- = ,[[]][][],
/ = ,]]][[[][,
" = ,[][][]][]],
' = ,[][][]][][,
; = ,[][][]][[[,
```

## The end
Anyway, enjoy making stuff with BrainLack! (or not)

Just so y'all know, I am not responsible for any brain cells you lose while using this. Have fun! :D
