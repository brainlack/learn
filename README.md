# Learning BrainLack
Of course, you may want to have followed the [docs](https://strywaretech.github.io/brainlack) if you want to go here.

## Syntax
So our syntax is pretty bad.

It consists of using brackets as a source of syntax. You may find all of that [here](https://github.com/strywaretech/brainlack/blob/main/compiler.js)

You place a comma (,) before starting your letters and after each letter since that was how the syntax was written. Your code should always end in a comma. 

Essentially, you just have to learn JS and all our bracket encoding listed below.

## List of letters/numbers
```
a = ,[[,
b = ,[],
c = ,][,
d = ,]],
e = ,[[[,
f = ,[]],
g = ,][[,
h = ,]][,
i = ,][],
j = ,[][,
k = ,]]],
l = ,[[[[,
m = ,[][],
n = ,][][,
o = ,[[]],
p = ,[][[,
q = ,][]],
r = ,]]]],
s = ,[[[],
t = ,]][],
u = ,[[][,
v = ,[[[][,
w = ,[]][,
x = ,]][[,
y = ,[[[[[,
z = ,[][[],
1 = ,[[][],
2 = ,[][][,
3 = ,[[][]][[,
4 = ,[[[[],
5 = ,[[][]][],
6 = ,[[]][],
7 = ,[[[]],
8 = ,[[[]]],
9 = ,[]][]],
0 = ,[[[]],
. = ,[[][]],
( = ,[[[]]]]],
) = ,[[][]]],
' = ,[[][]]],
_ = ,[[][[[],
  = ,[[]][][,
+ = ,[][][]][,
- = ,[[]][][],
/ = ,]]][[[][,
" = ,[][][]][]],
' = ,[][][]][][,
; = ,[][][]][[[,
```

## Running a simple hello
In order to run `console.log("hello, world");`, you might want to type this in:
```
,][,,[[]],,][][,,[[[],,[[]],,[[[[,,[[[,,[[][]],,[[[[,,[[]],,][[,,[[[]]]]],,[][][]][]],,]][,,[[[,,[[[[,,[[[[,,[[]],,,[[]][][,,[]][,,[[]],,]]]],,[[[[,,]],,[][][]][]],,[[][]]],,[][][]][[[[,
```
Notice how theres not a single letter or number? well we made it that way to make YOUR job harder.

Notice the syntax too; `h` was marked as `,]][,` and `e` would be followed as `,[[[,` and so on and so forth.

Another thing you might have noticed is the fact that the code ends in a comma, that was intentional since we ARE a hard language.

## The end
Anyway, enjoy making stuff with BrainLack! (or not)

Just so y'all know, I am not responsible for any brain cells you lose while using this. Have fun! :D
